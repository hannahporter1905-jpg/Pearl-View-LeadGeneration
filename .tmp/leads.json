I'm trying to tell you. Okay, thank you. Can we progress? Yeah, sure. So you say you live in Lismore, right? And you have like a single storey house, double storey house... Well, it's double storey on the sides that I need to have assistance with the window cleaning. Yeah, sure. And you'll be interested by both inside and outside of the window? No, just outside. Ah, just outside. Yeah, so for me it would be the best if you might have a picture of the house? Yes. Now before we go further, are you a legitimate company and do you have insurance? Yeah, sure. I can send you by email. I have public liability, insurance... Great, that's what I needed to know. Yep, okay. I can send you the documents by email if you need. Yes, now that's good.

Yeah, I mean, I would prefer it sort of this Thursday or Friday. I can do it as well if it's like really urgent for you. I can do it tomorrow, but it's going to be around 3, 3.30. 3.30. That's fine, because I will shoot you the photos in just one second. What I'd like you to do is to text me back or ring me back and say you've got the photos. Sure, I'm going to do it right now.

Again, again? Shall I use the email on the website? Keep in mind that the email doesn't include the price, so I can send you an email for now and we can schedule a call back later to get you the price. So when do you think is the best time for you to call back to get you the price? I first want to ask my manager what he thinks about it and then if it will be something that I will consider. You are the owner of the business? I am the owner but I have a manager of social media and Google Ads. Because of that, I want to ask him.

Yeah, sure. So how many bedrooms do you have in your home? It is a unit, two bedrooms. Yeah. And it's a single story or double story? No, no, a single story. It's four windows and one glass door. So in total it's only four windows and one glass door. That's right? Yeah, that is correct. And do you want in these windows be cleaned both inside and outside the windows? No, I don't think you can do outside because it's a second floor and you will need to be safe. So usually the body cork, that's the outside of the unit, but the inside I would like to clean it because I want to put new things in the window. Blinds. Ah, new blinds. So actually I have special equipment to clean windows until 9 meters, so I can do as well the outside if you want. Well, can you send me a quote with both inside and outside together? Yeah, sure. So I'm just going to give you a quote and the first quote will be only inside, okay? And it's going to cost you $220. Okay. And if you want to do it as well the outside, it's going to cost you $350. Ah, okay. Maybe, I don't know if I should ask permission the body cork to do outside, so maybe can we just do the inside this time? So let's do like that. We can do the inside this time and when my employee is going to get there, he's going to see the access. And if he's going to think it's okay to do the outside, we're going to do the outside as well. If not, we're going to do only the inside. That sounds okay for you? Yeah, what happens is I will need to talk with the manager because I don't know if we are allowed to do the outside because it's complex, you know? And maybe they say, oh, no, no, you are not allowed to touch because it's the responsibility of the body cork. So I know the inside is mine, so you can do the inside when you come. And in the future, if they will not do the outside, I will call you again. Is that okay? That's perfect. That's perfect. So let's book it. I'm going to have a look on my calendar for a second. Okay. What's your name, by the way? I'm Sonia. Sonia? Sonia, nice to meet you. I'm Eddie. Andy, nice to meet you, Andy. So for me, it would be the best to do it on Monday around 11.30? Yeah, you know, Monday and Tuesday next week, I should have told you, I am busy. But from Wednesday to Friday, I am free. So do you have any time after Tuesday? Yeah, I will have a look, one sec. Thank you. So Wednesday, Thursday or Friday next week, any time. Okay. So one second, I will have a look on my calendar. So Wednesday is okay for you? Yeah, yeah. Okay, perfect. Okay, so I just write it in my calendar, Sonia. Yeah, can I give you the address? Yeah, so what I'm going to do now, I just, this is my business number, I'm going to send you an SMS for my private number. Just text me, text me please your address and I will put it in my system, okay? Okay, just let me check that I got it. Okay, so what's your number again? Let me know. Tell me your number. Yeah, the number is 04-3-1-02-8-880. So two eights more and zero. 880, right? Yeah, yeah. And there is a special hour that you prefer to do it or it can be a bit later than the morning? Yeah, yeah. What time do you want to do it? I'll be there. Okay, perfect. So I will just take you exactly what time I'm going to be there and I'm going to send you a now message. Let me know if you got it. I will just send you now. I haven't got it yet. Yeah, I didn't send it. One second. I just sent it to you. Have you received it? Yeah, 80. Are you 80? Yeah. So I will send you in here a big number, the address and you will then, if you can send me the time so I am there. Yeah, sure. Sure, no worries. Okay, okay. I'll send you now the address. Thank you for your time. Thank you so much, Rania, and I see you on Wednesday. Yeah, and you tell me the time later. Yeah, yeah. I will just have a look with my employee what time will be the best.

I don't remember expecting anything, buddy. Because you didn't let me to refresh your memory. You told me that it's about marketing, and I told you yes. So I guess you remember me. And I don't need to... Have you got... Too many people calling me from my business from that, and I don't know what to do. And I don't know what to do. And I don't know what to do. for a week, just one second out of your time. We had a call before about getting your website on the same ad section 24-7, but with no limit on clicks for a fixed price. So no matter how many clicks you receive per day, your ad will never drop for only a fixed cost. And because you were busy the last time, you asked me to send an email, and we scheduled the callback to get you the price, because as I told you the last time, the email doesn't include the price. So if it's not a good time right now to get you the price, when do you think the best time for you to get you the price? Now. Okay, so the price is customized. It depends on two main factors, the keywords and the area you want to target. So let me save your time to get you the price, it's going to be through one of my account managers. Just one second, please. Thank you so much for holding, John. I'm one of the account managers at RMC. How are you? Hello. Can you hear me? Yeah. Hi. How are you today? Yeah, not too bad. Guys, if it's about marketing, I'd just like to answer you, but I'm not interested. So, yeah, thank you for that. Sure. Can I ask a quick question? Is that the kids for Lego? Yeah, sure. Sure. I like, I understand that you already run Google Adsense. You paid for it, right? Pardon? Like right now, you run Google Ads already, you paid for it, correct? Yeah. Okay. Now here's the thing, like, we're not talking about any, any different here. And instead of the normal challenge on Google Ads itself to pay per click and have limited clicks, sometimes being wasted, yeah, you've got to click something to disappear. I don't want to waste your time. My dad is doing it for me. I trust him. I really appreciate your time and your conversation. My dad doing it for me, this is his profession. Thank you for the time, guys. Please, I don't want to waste your time. Are you the owner or your dad? Are you the owner or your dad? I'm the owner. All right, great.

No, I just think it may be a little bit dark then. Yeah, that's not a problem. Yeah, OK, no worry. So I will text you, because I need to text the lady who lives at the house, my friend, and check with you at 5.30 is OK. Yes, so I will send you a message for my private number, because it's my business number. I will send you a message in a few minutes, because I'm driving right now. Sure, of course. And then you're going to send me the address, and if you want, you can send me the contact of the lady. OK. And I'm going to see you on the day. Yes, I'll come back to you.

We were speaking a little while ago. About what? We're talking about the Google Ads you're planning on setting up there. Yeah, yeah. So I think it's less relevant now. Thank you. Oh, what happened? Pardon? What happened there? Did you turn them off or are you still running them? The Google Ads? Yeah. You're still running those? Yeah. Yeah, cool, man. I wanted to give you a call because we work with a few window cleaners around Australia. And they're stuck with work. They're getting really good results. We just had no one there in Byron Bay. So I thought I'd give you a call. How have you been finding it? Have you been up and down at all? I need a small reminder. From Purge. We're up here in Brisbane. You're in Brisbane? Yeah. And what's your job? Are you promoting Google Ads? We're an agency. Okay. We have a few clients in the industry doing window cleaning. And they're getting really good results. We had no one in Byron Bay. So there was an open spot on our side. So that's why I was giving you a call. How have you been finding it? Pardon? How have you been finding the results? It's going pretty well. I'm using most of the time Google Ads. And soon I'm going to add Facebook and Instagram and social media. True. Okay. So if you're going to add those, I'm taking it you're looking for a bunch more work coming through, if that's the case. Yeah. Did you have an agency handling that for you? My dad is doing that because this is his job back home. But yeah, if you want to tell me about your services, I can add a few minutes to here. Well, I'd love to sit down and show you what's working for our clients. When would you be free? But just to be clear, you are managing social media campaigns, right? Oh, we do those as well. Yeah. We do everything here. So we can talk about both. We can talk about socials, Google Ads. We can talk about both of those in the next call. That's for me. What's that? I have someone doing Google Ads for me. Okay. Well, when would you be free to run through a strategy session? Let's say in 10 minutes I give you a call, you can call me back. But if you can call my private number because every click on my website costs me money. You call me through the website. Oh, really? How does that cost you money? Because every time you click on my website, it costs me money. Okay. What's your best number then? Your personal number? 0401. Yep. 308. 308. Yep. 180. 180. Cool, man. Will you be in front of a computer in 10? Yeah. Yeah. Cool. And what was your name? Sorry, I started the conversation. Asaf. A-S-A-F. A-S-A-F. Awesome. And you're just doing window cleaning?

Yeah, we have done like a good amount of cleaning on it already, so it just basically needs to be touched up on the windows, the tracks, the screens. Sure.

Okay, so for me it would be the best to just come have a look and give you a free quote. No problem. So I will be available. I have a small job around Malam. I can come have a look around three-ish if you're going to be home. Maybe tomorrow. I don't live here. Yes, so what did you say? Tomorrow will be better. Tomorrow I can do it really early because I have a big job at 9am. So I can come as well a bit later today. No, actually you don't really need me to be there anyway because you can see all the windows from the outside. Yeah, sure, but it's better to see the fly screen and the tracks if you want them because the tracks I cannot see from the outside. But yeah, anyway I can give you a rough quote for that. Yeah, okay, sure. I'm not actually living on the property so I have to come from Malam as well. Usually I'm there during the middle of the day. Okay, so if it's going to be there for you no worries. I can just come have a look and give you a quote. You want it interior and exterior as well? Fly screen and tracks or only the windows? No, no, interior, exterior, fly screen and tracks. Yeah, sure, no worries. So I'm going to send you a message for my private number. Then you're going to send me your address and I just come have a look today whenever I have free time and give you a quote for that. Sounds good? Yeah, that's very good. Thank you very much. Yeah, no worries. Cheers mate. Okay, bye. Bye bye.",

    "subject": "Yes, hi, I want to make an enquiry about your service. Yeah, sure. How are you doing? Good. So, I'm in a residential in a house in Lenox Head. Yeah, yeah. And I just wanted to know if you'd come and do my windows sometime? Yeah, sure. I'm working on Lenox, Balina, all these areas. I have a few clients as well that are going on a regular basis to maintain their windows. So, tell me, how many bedrooms do you have in your home? Well, the main bedroom is probably the most important. The main bedroom is upstairs. Yeah, so you have two storeys in your home. Two storey house. And then I've got a deck with sliding doors. Yeah. And then I've got an outside, just a small balcony, but it's also got sliding doors that need to be done. Yeah, yeah, sure. And then downstairs is like a little studio downstairs with a deck. And they've got sliding doors and an outside and a window, a big window there. Yeah, sure. That's the most important. The rest I don't care. The rest you don't care. Okay, so for me it will be the easiest. Usually when I'm doing these houses like that, or you can send me a few pictures of the windows, because I can just have a look on the real estate websites, some pictures of your house, but you want to do only some of the windows. That's true? That's true. It doesn't need all, because they don't get so badly splashed. So I'm not that worried. And I think it would be expensive to do quite a lot. Yeah, of course. I don't want to take money that is not necessary to clean. If the window is in good condition, so that's fine, you know? Yeah, yeah. I want to be happy and to do the best service for you. Thank you. What's your name, by the way? So my name is Erika. Erika. Lovely to meet you, Erika. I'm Asaf. So what are you going to do? What's your name? A-S-A-F. Asaf. Asaf, I've got a cousin. Yeah, it's a cousin called Asaf. Okay, nice. So what are you going to do? This is my business number. I'm going to send you a text message for my private number. Thank you. If you can just pop a few pictures of all the windows that you want to do, and as well mention, for example, you told me you have a second story, so underneath the photo, just give me a description, like this window is in the second story. You know what I mean? Okay, sure. Thank you, Erika. So I'll just send you a message right now. Send me a few photos in your own time, and I'm going to give you a quote for that. When do you want to do that? Like in the next few weeks? I don't know how busy you are, so it just depends what the price is and how busy you are. I'm not in a big rush. I haven't had them cleaned in five years, so it doesn't matter. Really, I think, no, I've had it once or twice now. It's not quite true. So I don't mind, we're home, so any time. Yeah, I'm quite busy, but I have, like, I think one more spot next week, but let's first begin, send me the photos, discuss the price, and then we'll see if we're happy from each other, okay? Okay, and just out of interest, because my bedroom window, for example, is in the second floor, is that going to be difficult if it's outside? I mean, it doesn't have to be outside, but would that be difficult? No, so I have machines that are doing it. It's called a purified water machine. Oh, good. Think like in your water, you have a lot of minerals. So when you're splashing this, like, water from the tub, this causes a trick. So I have machines with a pole that can reach up to nine meters. Oh, wonderful. Oh, good. Yeah, exactly. Great. Thanks, Asaf. Thank you. So looking forward to see the photos. I'm going to send you a text message right now, okay? Thank you very much.

    "subject": "Good morning. I was just wondering how much you charge to clean windows? Yeah, it depends on how many bedrooms you have in your house, how many stories, the condition of the windows as well. If you can give me a bit of more details, I can provide you a quote. Okay, so it's three bedrooms, one on the ground and the house is four years old. Yeah, and where are you located? In Mainam, Malambimbi. Yeah, actually I'm living in Malambimbi, so for me the easiest is just to come, have a look and give you a free quote. Okay, I'll be home, when can you do that? I can do it today, I'm working until six, I have a big project, I can do it tomorrow morning. Yeah, what time please? Tomorrow morning or today around six, whatever is better for you. Yeah, six o'clock, oh no, not today, tomorrow will be better. Yeah, sure, no worries. So what's your name by the way? Sally. Zoe, nice to meet you Zoe, I'm Rostaf. Hi. I will just send you a message through my private number, okay? This is my business number and send me the address over there and I'll see you tomorrow morning. Okay, great. I've had the windows cleaned before, but they're not a good job and really expensive. Like this girl had to clean one window, she just could not get it right. Yeah, you can have a look and I can send you as well a link for sales, I have more than 75 five-star reviews on Google My Business, so I can send you the sales and if you will not be happy for my service, I will not charge you of course. Anyway, come and have a look tomorrow, it will be great. No worries. I'll send you the address. Thank you. Cheers Zoe, I'm going to send you a message through my private number now. Cool, thank you.

And, um, it's been under renovation, so the windows, I usually clean them myself, but I'm just too busy, and I manage the property, it's a B&B, but it's just too big of a job for me. So, do you charge by the hour? Um, usually I'm doing, like, I have some clients that work with Airbnb companies that I do charge for hours, so we can do it like that. If it's a big job for you, it's, uh, it'd be more cheaper. And I'm usually charging $70 for an hour, and including all the equipment, and of course I'm sending for you an invoice. Yeah. And so, yes, for me, it would be easiest if you can just, I'm gonna send you a message for my private number, and then you're gonna send me your address there, and then I can assess, like, roughly how many hours it will take me, and then you will know, like, roughly the price is gonna be. Okay, so, but basically it's about $70 an hour. And then you can sort of tell me how long it's gonna take you. It's inside and out. If it's a second story, it's usually taking around, you want it clean as well, the fly screen and the tracks, or only the windows? No, the fly screens and tracks are fine. Yeah. Just the windows, yep. So, usually it takes five, six hours, roughly. Yeah. Okay. Okay, I have to get back to you because I'm actually calling on behalf of the owner. I've just managed the property. Yeah, of course. So, I'll get back to you. Okay, thank you very much. So, you want to send me your address, or you just want to call me back? I'll give you a call back once I talk to the owner. Okay.

I'm located in Benogan on the Gold Coast. Yeah, yeah, no worries. And it's three bedrooms, one storey? Single storey. It's about, it's probably about 20, 20 squares the house. Yeah, yeah. Three bedrooms and an office. And an office. Yeah. Like you have the unit of office and as well a house with three bedrooms, right? No, no, the office is part of the house. Oh, okay. And you have maybe some pictures of the house? I can have a look as well in the real estate. Usually I'm going to give you like roughly price of that is going to be between $300 to $400. Okay, so does that include, does that include doing the screens and the trucks? The fly screen? Yeah. It's not included but let me have a look when I have time because I'm walking next to your area and if you want I can do it like let's say in $400 including the trucks and the fly screen. Okay, look I probably should just qualify as well. They're not, they're fly screens but they're actually security screens. Oh, security. Yeah, you can't actually remove them. Yeah, they screwed in. Yeah, so on the inside you can lift out some of the windows. So what I'm doing usually when I have like this type of fly screen is I have like a machine that's called water pad, it's purified water and I'm just washing it because I cannot remove it, you know. So I just wash the screen, the brush and then I just go to the inside of the house, take off the windows and then I will clean the both sides of the window. This is how I'm doing it usually. Okay, all right. That sounds, that sounds, that sounds good, yeah. I've just had people come out and say I can't do the windows, I can't get the screen out and I just think, or I can't, yeah, I just think that's not good enough. So as long as you can sort of do what you can that would be great. Yeah, maybe they wasn't like professionally window cleaner, you know, like you just pull out the windows. Like some windows you can't but if it's going to be something like that I will not charge you if I'm not cleaning the windows, you know. Yeah, okay. But I didn't have any job that I didn't succeed to do yet in the last three years, so. Okay. All good. So when could you do it? When can I do it? Yeah. You're doing, one second. Actually, wait, no. How urgent is that? Look, it's not urgent because I haven't had them done for ages, so they are very dirty. They are very dirty. Okay. So next week I'm going to do it. The week after I can do it, I have three available spots. If you want, I can tell you which date and we can book it in. Okay, so what week are you free? Let me have a look. What's your name, by the way? Susan. Susan, nice to meet you. I'm Astash, A-S-T-A-S. Ah, cool. Thank you. Yeah, so next week, the week after, I can do it. Let's say Tuesday, the 4th of November. Okay. Are you able to do it? I'm actually not around that day. Are you able to do it on the 5th? On there? Or the 6th or 7th? Hang on, hang on. Sorry. Are you able to do it on Friday the 7th? Yeah. You can do it on Friday the 7th? Yeah. Yeah, okay. That would be good because I'll be home all day. Yeah, cool. So yeah, if you can just send me your address. I'm going to send you now a message. This is my business number that you're calling. I'm just going to send you a message through my private number. Okay. And you'll send me your address and the name again, that I will have it on my phone. Okay. And I will confirm with you as well in the week before. Okay. So what's your mobile? My mobile, 0401. 0401. 308. Yep. 180. Okay, so I will text you my name and address now and then you've got my mobile. And your name was, what was your name again? ASAS. ASAS. Okay, thank you. Alright. Yeah, it's a bit hard. I'm always, this is like one thing I'm like a bit trouble with clients, you know. Okay. But yeah, I will confirm with you the week before. Okay. Alright. $400, two bedrooms. Like you have two bedrooms and one office, right? Three bedrooms and an office. Yeah, so it's going to be around $400. Like it's not going to be much more, you know, like $400. Do you give discounts for cash? Yeah, yeah. Okay, I can pay you cash. Cash is king. Yeah. So yeah, it's going to be around $400, not much more, you know. It's going to depend on the condition of the windows and things like that. But you'll be included in the slide screen. Okay.

What time will you be able to do something tomorrow? Yeah, yeah. But I'm finishing my project in around 2 p.m. So I can do it in two, if that's fine for you? Two o'clock, yeah. Yeah, that sounds good. A quote and do this at two o'clock. Yeah, listen, I can give you a quote and if you would be happy with the quote, I can just do it on the place because I'll be already there. Done. Two o'clock. Two o'clock. What's your name, by the way? My name is Jay. Jay. Nice to meet you, Jay. I'm a staff. Who? What's your name? I'm going to send you by text message. So I'm just going to send you a text message in SMS in a few minutes because now I'm in the middle of driving. And you're going to send me your address and I see you tomorrow around 2 p.m. And I will let you know exactly what time I'm going to finish, which is going to be roughly around two. That's fine for you? Yeah, that's great. And you're OK with some of the windows that are done? I just had a gentleman turn up and he wouldn't clean windows. He wouldn't just do half of them. He would happily do all of them. Are you all right? Yeah, all good. Yeah, sure. I'm going to help you with whatever you need. You know, I will not charge you on things that I'm not doing. I really appreciate that. Of course, of course. Did you say your name is Asaf? Yeah, exactly. Asaf. Beautiful. I'm going to send you a text message in a few minutes and just send me your address. I'm going to see you tomorrow at 2 p.m. Beautiful. I will do that for you. Get your message. Perfect. Cheers. Thank you so much. Thank you. No worries. Bye bye.",

I'm in Balinga on the southern Gold Coast, I was just wondering if you might be able to give me a rough quote and give me a time when you might be able to do it. Yeah sure, actually today I'm working next to you, I'm going to finish around 4.35ish and I can just come and provide you a free quote. If you can come later this afternoon after 5 o'clock, is that when you finish? I'm not sure when exactly I'm going to finish, but it will be roughly around 4.35, but if you want me to wait a bit, that's fine as well. No, no, that's okay, I'll be home probably about 2 o'clock, from then on I'll be home, so that would be great. Yeah, that's perfect. What's your name by the way? My name's Linda McPherson. Linda. Yep. Yep. So Linda, I'm just going to send you a text message through my private number, okay? Yes, yes.
