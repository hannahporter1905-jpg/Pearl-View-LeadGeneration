## Notes

- Phase 1 is the MVP — get this right first before adding complexity
- Status pipeline is the single most important feature after the lead list
- Call recordings must be stored securely and accessible quickly (owner needs to reference them during callbacks)
- Mobile-friendly design is important — owner likely checks leads from a phone
